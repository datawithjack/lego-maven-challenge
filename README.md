## Project Report: Exploration of LEGO Minifigure Evolution

### Objective:
This project aimed to explore the history and evolution of LEGO minifigures, tracing their growth and development over the years. 

### Methodology:

#### Data Collection and Initial Analysis with Excel:
A comprehensive dataset of LEGO sets, including details on the year of release, theme, number of pieces, and minifigures, was provided for this challenge.
Preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted using Excel. This phase involved filtering, sorting, and basic statistical analysis to identify initial trends and patterns in the data, particularly focusing on the frequency and characteristics of minifigures in the sets.

#### Advanced Visualization with Power BI: 
The cleaned and structured dataset from Excel was imported into Power BI.
Advanced visualizations were created to illustrate the evolution of LEGO minifigures. These included time-series analyses showing the growth decade over decade in the number of minifigures and thematic comparisons.
Interactive elements were incorporated to allow dynamic exploration of the data, such as filtering by decade and by theme using the bar charts.
Given that the 2020s decade is incomplete the decade over decade comparisons were computed against 2017-2019 to give meaningful comparisons of recent growth.

#### Supplementary Internet Research:
To augment the data analysis, additional research was conducted via the internet. This research provided context on key milestones in LEGO minifigure history, such as the introduction of the modern minifigure in 1978, the expansion of themed and licensed sets in the 2000s, and recent trends towards increased diversity and character-driven sets.
This qualitative information was crucial in interpreting the data trends and provided a narrative to the story of LEGO minifigures.

### Findings:

Growth Trends: A significant increase in the number of minifigures per set was observed, especially post-2000, coinciding with LEGO's strategic shift towards licensed themes and character-driven sets.
Theme and Design Evolution: Changes in minifigure design and variety were closely tied to the introduction of new themes, especially licensed franchises.

### Conclusion:

The project successfully mapped the historical trajectory of LEGO minifigures. The combination of quantitative data analysis with qualitative research provided a comprehensive understanding of the minifigures' journey from simple, generic figures to diverse, character-rich elements that are central to the LEGO experience.
